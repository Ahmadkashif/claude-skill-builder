# Product Sense and Experimentation

**What it is:** Beyond shipping code, senior engineers connect technical choices to user outcomes. Inspired by *Accelerate* and *The Pragmatic Programmer*, they frame hypotheses, measure impact, and iterate quickly while keeping systems reliable.

**Examples in practice**
- Define metrics that reflect user value (conversion, latency-to-first-action) and instrument experiments to learn fast.
- Use feature flags to A/B test safely, rolling back variants that degrade SLOs or user experience.
- Partner with product and design to simplify scope, reducing time-to-value without compromising architectural soundness.
