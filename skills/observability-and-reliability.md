# Observability and Reliability

**What it is:** In line with Google’s *Site Reliability Engineering*, observability lets engineers ask new questions of systems without code changes. Senior engineers design for reliability with budgets (SLOs), error budgets, and feedback loops that keep systems healthy and teams aligned.

**Examples in practice**
- Define service-level objectives for latency and availability, then wire alerts to error-budget burn instead of raw CPU.
- Instrument structured logs, traces, and metrics that connect user symptoms to underlying causes across services.
- Run game days and chaos experiments to validate failure isolation and recovery procedures before incidents happen.
