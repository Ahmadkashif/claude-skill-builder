# Technical Leadership and Mentorship

**What it is:** Senior 10X engineers multiply impact through people. Influenced by *The Pragmatic Programmer* and *Accelerate*, they set technical vision, create alignment, and grow others via mentoring, pairing, and clear communication.

**Examples in practice**
- Facilitate design reviews that surface risks early and align teams on interfaces and success criteria.
- Pair with teammates on high-risk changes, teaching debugging techniques and refactoring habits from *Clean Code*.
- Create growth plans and learning paths, ensuring the team can own systems collectively rather than relying on heroes.
