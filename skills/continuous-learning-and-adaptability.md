# Continuous Learning and Adaptability

**What it is:** Great engineers keep learning, as urged by *The Pragmatic Programmer*. They adapt to new domains, tools, and constraints, using feedback from *Accelerate* metrics to improve both process and architecture without destabilizing delivery.

**Examples in practice**
- Schedule regular retros and tech debts days, turning findings into small, trackable improvements.
- Prototype new approaches behind toggles, validating value with metrics before broader rollout.
- Maintain personal learning roadmaps, sharing takeaways via brown bags so the team benefits together.
