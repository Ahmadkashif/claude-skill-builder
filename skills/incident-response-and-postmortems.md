# Incident Response and Postmortems

**What it is:** Borrowing from *Site Reliability Engineering*, senior engineers prepare for failure. They design clear ownership, runbooks, and communication patterns, and treat incidents as learning opportunities through blameless postmortems.

**Examples in practice**
- Standardize runbooks with detection steps, mitigations, and escalation paths, validated during game days.
- Lead incident bridges with concise status updates, separating mitigation from diagnosis to shorten MTTR.
- Write blameless postmortems that capture timeline, contributing factors, and concrete action items with owners.
