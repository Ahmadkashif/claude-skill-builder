# Code Quality and Maintainability

**What it is:** Inspired by *Clean Code* and *The Pragmatic Programmer*, senior engineers create code that is easy to read, test, and change. They enforce clear boundaries, remove ambiguity, and invest in automation that keeps quality high without slowing delivery.

**Examples in practice**
- Replace large classes with cohesive modules and pure functions, increasing test coverage while shrinking bug rates.
- Introduce fast, reliable linters and contract tests that block regressions before merge.
- Refactor risky areas incrementally behind feature flags, keeping deploys small and reversible per *Accelerate* practices.
