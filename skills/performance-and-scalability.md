# Performance and Scalability

**What it is:** Senior engineers measure before they optimize. Guided by *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* and *Site Reliability Engineering*, they profile real workloads, remove bottlenecks, and design capacity models that grow cost-effectively.

**Examples in practice**
- Use flame graphs and tracing to reduce p99 latency by addressing the hottest 5% of code paths.
- Add back-pressure and circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures under load spikes.
- Plan capacity with load tests that mimic traffic patterns, then right-size resources to control spend.
