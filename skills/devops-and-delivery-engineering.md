# DevOps and Delivery Engineering

**What it is:** Anchored in *Accelerate*, senior engineers build delivery pipelines that make shipping boring. They shorten feedback loops with automation, trunk-based development, and safe deployment patterns that keep quality high while enabling frequent releases.

**Examples in practice**
- Implement continuous integration with fast, deterministic builds and tests triggered on every change.
- Use progressive delivery (feature flags, canaries, blue/green) to reduce blast radius and roll back instantly.
- Automate dependency updates and security scans so the main branch stays deployable every day.
